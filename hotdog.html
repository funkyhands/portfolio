            I sat in my room staring at my Soma hanging on the wall, at my fully filled panniers which were ready to explore the world. Physically, I was ready but mentally, not so much. Pre trip anxiety kicked in, which was a first for me. "Heck it let's go", I thought to myself,
            I didn't know what to expect, but thats the fun part about it. <br><br> I took one last look at my room, said my goodbyes to my family and cycled off to Woodlands to spend the night at a friend of Aaron's so that we can clear immigrations as early as possible the next morning. 
            As I was cycling along Woodlands avenue 12, I felt my bike shaking, I looked down to find a punctured rear tyre. "Shag" was the only word I could think of — not a great start to the month long bicycle tour. It was already 1:30 in the morning, I quickly get off and replaced 
            the tube and proceeded to cycle to the apartment to get some sleep.

        <p class="text">
            We woke up at around 5:30 in the morning, left the apartment and immediately made our way to Woodlands checkpoint. It felt weird riding this early in the morning, Aaron and I only cycled at night in Singapore, so getting used to this won't be easy,
            then again we have more than enough time. <br><br> We were unsure of which lane to be in so we stayed on the left most lane which led to the first auto gate, we tried to enter but the machine wouldn't detect us. The ICA officer came to us to "scold" us telling us to
            use the manual gate at the end of the road. (also all this happened while Aaron was wearing the whole hotdog bun suit lmao.) The malay ICA lady at the manual gate was confused when she saw us pushing our bikes up to her, we tried to explain the whole
            pun and the fundraiser but she didn't understand. She checked our passports and let us through regardless. We cleared the malaysian immigration and we were in MALAYSIA.

            The roads in Johor Bahru were pretty crazy. We ended up on the wrong highway and had to carry our bikes out of the road and find correct way out. We eventually made it out and found a petrol station — the first of many petrol station pit stops — to resup on water.
            After 30 minutes of riding, we stopped at some random chinese food stall in Skudai to have our breakfast. I forgot what we had but I remember it was pretty alright. We rested for abit and planned our route for the rest of the day before setting off for the first long ride. We cycled out of JB
            on Jalan Besar, a smaller road parallel to North-South Expressway, stopping every 2-3 hours to rest. We stopped at a Family Mart in Simpang Renggam in the afternoon for lunch, at this point we were extremely lethargic from getting used to the new work rest cycle. 
            We rested here for almost 2 hours.
