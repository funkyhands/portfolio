            I am writing this in 2024, 2 years after the expedition so I will try to remember as much detail as I can for the first day and just cover some key moments for the rest of the trip after.

            I sat in my room staring at my Soma hanging on the wall, at my fully filled panniers which were ready to explore the world. Physically, I was ready but mentally, not so much. Pre trip anxiety kicked in, which was a first for me. "Heck it let's go", I thought to myself,
            I didn't know what to expect, but thats the fun part about it. <br><br> I took one last look at my room, said my goodbyes to my family and cycled off to Woodlands to spend the night at a friend of Aaron's so that we can clear immigrations as early as possible the next morning. 
            As I was cycling along Woodlands avenue 12, I felt my bike shaking, I looked down to find a punctured rear tyre. "Shag" was the only word I could think of — not a great start to the month long bicycle tour. It was already 1:30 in the morning, I quickly get off and replaced 
            the tube and proceeded to cycle to the apartment to get some sleep.

        <p class="text">
            We woke up at around 5:30 in the morning, left the apartment and immediately made our way to Woodlands checkpoint. It felt weird riding this early in the morning, Aaron and I only cycled at night in Singapore, so getting used to this won't be easy,
            then again we have more than enough time. <br><br> We were unsure of which lane to be in so we stayed on the left most lane which led to the first auto gate, we tried to enter but the machine wouldn't detect us. The ICA officer came to us to "scold" us telling us to use the manual gate at the end of the road.
            (Also, all this happened while Aaron was wearing the hotdog bun suit lmao) The malay ICA lady at the manual gate was confused when she saw a hot dog pushing a bicycle up to her, we tried to explain the whole pun and the fundraiser but she didn't understand.
            She checked our passports and let us through regardless. We cleared the Malaysian immigration and there we were, we were in MALAYSIA.

            The roads in Johor Bahru were pretty crazy. We ended up on the wrong highway and had to carry our bikes out of the road and find correct way out. We eventually made it out and found a petrol station — the first of many petrol station pit stops — to resup on water before continuing our journey.<br><br>
            After 30 minutes of riding, we stopped at some random chinese food stall in Skudai to have our breakfast. I forgot what we had but I remember it was pretty alright. We rested for abit and planned our route for the rest of the day before setting off for the first long ride. We cycled out of JB
            on Jalan Besar, a smaller road parallel to North-South Expressway, stopping every 2-3 hours to rest. We stopped at a Family Mart in Simpang Renggam in the afternoon for lunch, at this point we were extremely lethargic from getting used to the new work rest cycle. 
            We rested here for almost 2 hours.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            We left the comfort of Family Mart and continued pedaling towards Yong Peng, which was our goal for the day. We would pitch our tent at a very nice water body named Tasik Berlian that we found on Google maps just 10km after the town. 
            We made a quick dinner stop, after 40km of cycling, at a restaurant in Ayer Hitam at around 4:30pm. We fell asleep while waiting for our food; the afternoon sun on the way here was "no joke".
            Food came, we ate, it was still quite early in the day so we packed some food just in case we were hungry at our campsite later at night. <br><br>
            Last 40 km of the day, sun was setting, everything was going really well. As we approached the pinned location on our map, we were cycling on gravel roads and the place looked different from the map. The water body had been fenced off completely and surrounded by dense plantation. Not giving up,
            we pushed our bicycles through the vegetation along the fence, hoping to find a nice place to set up. We didn't. It was getting dark already so we made do with whatever little space we could find and pitched our tent to rest for the night. It was not a comfortable spot to sleep in — 3/10.

            Finally, after over 10 hours of cycling and about 130km covered, we have reached our first night of our month long tour. Saddle sores, burnt skin and horrible diet — despite all that, I am still excited for what's to come.
            We sat in our tents, ate our packed food and planned tomorrows route before recharging.
