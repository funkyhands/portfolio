                My responsibilities include the conceptual ideation and development of corporate projects, where I collaborate closely with clients
                to understand their vision and objectives. This process involves extensive brainstorming and design development to create innovative
                solutions that align with the client’s goals. I also specialize in 3D modelling, crafting detailed and realistic representations of
                the projects. Additionally, I am responsible for preparing comprehensive presentation decks, which 
                are essential for client discussions. My work ensures that all presentation materials are compelling and
                persuasive, facilitating successful client meetings and competitive tender bids.

                <p class="body">Sep 2022 - Apr 2023</p>
                I had the opportunity to lead a variety of projects, ranging from residential to retail, managing them from start to finish.
                This required me to oversee all phases of the project, ensuring that each one was executed to the highest standards. I managed a team of contractors on site,
                coordinating their efforts to maintain workflow efficiency and quality. Collaboration with clients was another key aspect of my role, as I worked closely with them to understand their vision and requirements.
                Through regular consultations and updates, I ensured that their expectations were not only met but exceeded. This client-focused approach was crucial
                in producing the final outcome of each project, delivering results that aligned perfectly with their needs and desires.
